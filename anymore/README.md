<!-- cargo-rdme start -->

The Anymore crate provides the [`AnyDebug`][] trait, for dynamically typed values which
can be inspected in Rust.

These can be used in any program domain, but have been developed with graphical
user interface libraries as the target consumer.
The `AnyDebug` trait also has the [`type_name`](AnyDebug::type_name) method, which
can be used to access the type name of the contained value.

## Usage

The traits in this crate can be used in the same way that you would use
[`Any`], with the additional capability that the Debug implementation is meaningful.
See the [module-level documentation][core::any] of `Any` for more details of how it
can be used.

## Smart pointers and `dyn AnyDebug`

When you have `dyn AnyDebug` contained in a smart pointer, such as [`Box`] or
[`Arc`][alloc::sync::Arc],
the [`type_name`][AnyDebug::type_name] method will give the type name of the smart
pointer, rather than the type name of the contained value. This can be avoided by
converting the smart pointer into a `&dyn AnyDebug` instead, which will return the
objectâ€™s type name. This is the [same caveat][core::any#smart-pointers-and-dyn-any]
seen with the`type_id` method on `Any`.

## Motivation

In user interface contexts, there is often a need for passing dynamically typed values.
In [Xilem](https://docs.rs/xilem/latest/xilem/), for example, one of the key concepts is
dispatching arbitrary messages to the correct component (called `View` in `Xilem`).
Each `View` expects messages of a specific type or types, and knows how to handle these.
However, sometimes, due to bugs elsewhere in the app, a view will receive a message of a
type it didn't expect. If it were using the standard library, `Any` type, there would be no
feasible way for the author of that `View` implementation to learn what the underlying type was.
This can make understanding this failure quite challenging.
Because of this, Xilem uses the `AnyDebug` trait for these messages, so they can be inspected.

A similar need arises in [Masonry](https://docs.rs/masonry/latest/masonry/), which is the widget toolkit
co-developed with Xilem.

## Feature Flags

The following crate [feature flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html#dependency-features) are available:

- `alloc` (enabled by default): Implement downcasting from [`Box`]es.
  If this feature is not enabled, Anymore can be used in contexts without an allocator enabled.
- `type_name` (enabled by default): Provide the `type_name` function on `AnyDebug`, which gives the type's name.
  Most users should leave this enabled, as the costs of this method existing are expected to be negligible.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of Anymore has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.86** and later.

Future versions of Anymore might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.
