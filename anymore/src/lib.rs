//! The Anymore crate provides the [`AnyDebug`][] trait, for dynamically typed values which
//! can be inspected in Rust.
//!
//! These can be used in any program domain, but have been developed with graphical
//! user interface libraries as the target consumer.
//! The `AnyDebug` trait also has the [`type_name`](AnyDebug::type_name) method, which
//! can be used to access the type name of the contained value.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The traits in this crate can be used in the same way that you would use
//! [`Any`], with the additional capability that the Debug implementation is meaningful.
//! See the [module-level documentation][core::any] of `Any` for more details of how it
//! can be used.
//!
//! ## Smart pointers and `dyn AnyDebug`
//!
//! When you have `dyn AnyDebug` contained in a smart pointer, such as `Box` or `Arc`,
//! the [`type_name`][AnyDebug::type_name] method will give the type name of the smart
//! pointer, rather than the type name of the contained value. This can be avoided by
//! converting the smart pointer into a `&dyn AnyDebug` instead, which will return the
//! objectâ€™s type name. This is the [same caveat][core::any#smart-pointers-and-dyn-any]
//! seen with the`type_id` method on `Any`.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! In user interface contexts, there is often a need for passing dynamically typed values.
//! In [Xilem](https://docs.rs/xilem/latest/xilem/), for example, one of the key concepts is
//! dispatching arbitrary messages to the correct component (called `View` in `Xilem`).
//! Each `View` expects messages of a specific type or types, and knows how to handle these.
//! However, sometimes, due to bugs elsewhere in the app, a view will receive a message of a
//! type it didn't expect. If it were using the standard library, `Any` type, there would be no
//! feasible way for the author of that `View` implementation to learn what the underlying type was.
//! This can make understanding this failure quite challenging.
//! Because of this, Xilem uses the `AnyDebug` trait for these messages, so they can be inspected.
//!
//! A similar need arises in [Masonry](https://docs.rs/masonry/latest/masonry/), which is the widget toolkit
//! co-developed with Xilem.
//!
